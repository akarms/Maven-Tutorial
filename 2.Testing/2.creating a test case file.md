for creating a test file for a java file you have to make a java file in the test folder

for first make sure you have test dependency in the pom.xml file
<br>
if not you have to add the dependency 
<br> for that First install it by 

```bash
mvn install
```
<br>
then only you can import those dependency for java file

[here you can see latest dependencies](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng)

so in the xml file dependency has to be like this

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
    <version>7.8.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

```
---

then you have to make a java file in the test folder
<br>

**make sure you are importing the testng package in the java file**

```java
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

```

then you could add the test annotation to the method you want to test
<br>
for example assume there is a calculator in main java
<br>

the claculaterTest.java file be like 

```java

public class CalculatorTest{
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

    @Test
    public void testadd(){

        // int actualSum = calc.add(2, 3);
        // int expectedSum = 5;
        // if(actualSum != expectedSum){
        //     throw new Error("2 + 3 should be 5");
        // }
        //we  can do those thing alternativly bt 

        Assert.assertEquals(calc.add(2, 5), 7);

    }
}

```


After test cases added all you have to run

```bash
mvn install
```
if it has any errors it will point out
