###### in the pom.xml file we can change the app name that will shown in jar file 


```xml

  <groupId>com.mycompany.app</groupId>
  <artifactId>Calculator</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>

```

###### in here by changing the artifactId we can change the app name that will shown in jar file
###### also we can change the version of the app by changing the version tag

###### if we wanted to run that jar file without maven an additional work has to be dond
###### we have to add the main class to the manifest file
###### by adding below plugin we can do that

```xml

 
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.1.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <archive>
            <manifest>
              <mainClass>com.mycompany.app.App</mainClass>
            </manifest>
          </archive>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>

```


###### now all we have to do to run is typing below command
**java -jar target/Calculator-1.1.jar**

###### java -jar (jar name).jar
